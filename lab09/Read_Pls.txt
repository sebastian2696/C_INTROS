Because the skeleton code and the instructions require us to use the getline function, we found that
additional white space was being incorporated into the cat, and was preventing our uniq function from
finding the complete number of instances of words. To correct this, we ran the funtion sed '/^s*$/d'
in our pipeline. The code is above so that you can reproduce our results as we found them. This code eliminates the spaces created by getline.
